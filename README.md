PINN for viv of a cylinder

This is a pytorch implementation of PINN for a viv cylinder. The training data is from a 2D simulations of a laminar flow past a viv cylinder at Re=200 and a reduced velocity 
This PINN code is originally modified from https://github.com/ComputationalDomain/PINNs/tree/main/Cylinder-Wake by considering the structural response.

The code is still developed and optimized and it is appreciated to contact me (guang.yin@uis.no) if you find any problem.
